# Melvor Idle - Probability Distributions
Prob Dist Calculator

**Who is this calculator for?**
-- Anyone wondering how many clears of a certain dungeon it will take to get the specific items your after

-- Anyone wanting to see the probability distribution, check how many clears it would take for you to be among the 5% unluckiest people!

-- Anyone who invests hours in number crunching despite the game requiring very little input!

**What can I test**

An example of what you can test is below:

```python3
CPU-Usage: '1' - (low - only for very low probability tests), '2' - (medium), '3' - (high - freaky are ya?): 2

What is the name of item 1? helm
What is the drop rate (0 < p <= 1) of helm? 0.00415
Any more items? Enter any key if yes, otherwise enter 'n': 

What is the name of item 2? s
What is the drop rate (0 < p <= 1) of s? 0.00415
Any more items? Enter any key if yes, otherwise enter 'n': 

What is the name of item 3? sd
What is the drop rate (0 < p <= 1) of sd? 0.0028
Any more items? Enter any key if yes, otherwise enter 'n': 

What is the name of item 4? sd
What is the drop rate (0 < p <= 1) of sd? 0.0028
Any more items? Enter any key if yes, otherwise enter 'n': n
